=============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
git-new-fb - Create a new feature branch based on the integration branch.


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-new-fb' ['OPTIONS'] [ 'branchname' ]


OPTIONS
-------

The effective default is "*git new-fb -i* 'branch_name'".

*-l, --local*::
    Do not do a fetch first if there is a remote defined

*--info*::
    Informational messages; show the major things this is doing (*default: true*)

*-q, --quiet*::
    Quiet messages; only show errors

*-v, --verbose*::
    Verbose messages; show lots of details on what this is doing

*--version*::
    Print version and exit


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Options for 'git-new-fb(1)' are set using 'git-config(1)'.

*gitProcess.remoteName*::
    Allows you to explicitly set the remote server name to use. Defaults
    to the first server name reported by 'git-remote(1)'.

*gitProcess.integrationBranch*::
    Allows you to explicitly set the integration branch to use. Defaults
    to "master".


EXAMPLE
-------

Assuming that the the integration branch on the server is "master",
running "git new-fb my_feature" will do roughly the following
for you:

  $ git fetch -p
  $ git checkout my_feature origin/master

Also, if you are currently on the "_parking_" branch (see 'git-to-master(1)'),
this will remove that branch.
